pytut
=====

A collection of Python tutorials in IPython Notebook format, borrowed from the [Python Bootcamp](http://www.pythonbootcamp.info/) at UC Berkeley. [Original Github repo](https://github.com/profjsb/python-bootcamp).   

To get in running, make sure you have IPython Notebook installed first. On Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook`.   

Then,   

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kqdtran/pytut.git    
cd pytut    
ipython notebook
```   

Navigate to port 8888 (or which ever the command line output says) and enjoy the notebooks. 
To run it as a background job, do `Ctrl+Z` and type `bg` into the command line.
